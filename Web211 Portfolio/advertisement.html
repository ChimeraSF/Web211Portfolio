    <p>I tried to keep this ad pretty simple. My color choices were picked from the colors on the hammock. For the 'RELAX' text I brought the color fill down to 0% to give it a see-through quality, then added a drop shadow and stroke to help it stand out. I also gave it the 'Web' pattern overlay at a lower opacity, to give it a sort of bubbly look. Lastly, I increased the spacing between the letters. I placed both the boat and logo into the image, then typed the lower text, and copied the 'RELAX' styles to all of these, adding minor changes. The lower text is at 45% fill, and the logo is at 100%. I also gave the image itself an inside stroke. Finally, I added the 3strip color lookup to give the image richer colors.</p>
